You can ask about deffective scrolls and he will sell the same scrolls as the wizard
for 1 gold each.

He also sells the regular version of the scrolls for 100 gold each.

You can also ask him to make you any scroll you want for 10 gold each but must wait a day.
The scroll will never be the exact scroll you want since Mark isn't a natural magic user and 
only really dables in it for fun.

You can also buy books from him and there is a book that can be bought to complete a quest.
