In the drunken fly there is a man who asks only for someone to tell him a story. 
Upon either telling a pretty good story or rolling a (DC 20) performance check 
he will award the players with a valuable wine that his family has produced for 
decades. Drinking the wine while you are indoxicated your vision becomes unreliable 
and you now have a chance to see something however you gain advantage in all checks.
Minus checks for if something is real or not.
