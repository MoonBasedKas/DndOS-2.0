If you ask if Adrik needs help he will request a wellness check on his grandmother. As he hasn't 
had the chance to check up on her in a while and she normally sends him a letter by now. 
He will give directions to the house from the tavern. Upon entering you will see nothing but a skull 
remains in the living room of her house. If you attempt an invetsigation check you will find a letter 
tagged Psi.

If you ask the assassian about it he will tell you he will tell you he was tasked to kill them by an 
unknown buyer. You can persaude Omega into telling you who with a (DC 20) roll and he will tell you 
its the bartender.

If you tell the bartender about it he will thank you and give each party memeber a potion of haste.

If you tell the bartender who did it he will once again thank you and give 10 gold to each member. 
Telling you he will take care of that later.

If you ask the bartender why he killed his grandma he will tell you to keep it a secret and that 
he wanted her inheritance as she had promised a large sum of money and the property in her name.
He promised the assassian free room and board.

If you tell the gaurds about the murder about accuse the bartender they will say we had a feeling 
he was up to no good. There's been a string of disapearances recently and they'll interogate the bartender 
about it later. 

His wife will now replace him as the inkeeper and when you look in the dungeon he will be there dead.

If you tell the guards about the assassian he assassian will actually disapear unknowningly however checking the window there 
will be a note. Telling you someone had caught onto his ploy and he's had to flee the town. Tlatemmati will actually comment 
on this saying it is tragic he's left as Tlatemmati is the reason he was here in the first place. As the place reeks of bhaal 
worship and hoped he would have eventually done it himself. Tlatemmati will remove his restriction upon the assassian leaving.
