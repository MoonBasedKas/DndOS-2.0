Upon entering Tlatamatti will give you his spiel and then tell you to enter through the front door. 
When entering you'll seen the room under construction and Tlatamatti will tell you he should have contracted 
someone else to do this. Disapointed he will instruct you to just go into the next room. 

If you investigate you'll notice nobody has touched this place in a while as if they just took the money and 
ran away. You may also hear slight banging on the wall. You can also find a rune powder bomb that will destroy 
the wall. Upon exploding it does 4d12 Damage within a 30ft radius. When exploding you'll find a caved in area 
with skeletons strung across and a singular zombie who died during the blast.
