Upon entering you will see a man sitting while surrounded by 10 rats in a circle. 
Getting within 30 feet the rats will begin to go after you. If you are within 10 feet,
attack the rat king, or kill 6 rats he will begin to attack. 


You are in a wine cellar.

Casting the cursed scroll of fireball Tlatemmati will actually scold you for shooting a fireball 
at his castle and you should have check what the scroll did instead of trusting a random wizard 
giving free scrolls away.
